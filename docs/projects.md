## The <i str>"pyproject.toml"</i> file

`pkm` projects follows PEPs
[631](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0631/), [621](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0621/),
[517](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517)
and [518](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518). It reads the project configuration from the standard
<i str>"pyproject.toml"</i> file. `toml` is a fairly human-readable format, you can learn more about
it [here](https://toml.io/en/).

There are two main tables which contains the configuration relevant to pkm:

- The <i tag>[project]</i> table, holds the standard project's metadata
- The <i tag>[tool.pkm]</i> table, holds pkm-specific features configuration

### The <i tag>[project]</i> table

> ‚òùÔ∏èÔ∏è The following documentation is based mainly on [PEP 621](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0621/), you may want to refer to it for further details.

<br>
The <i tag>[project]</i> section is the main section to configure your project metadata, since most of the values in
this section are self-explanatory, we will begin with an example ([source](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0621/)):

```toml
# pyproject.toml
[project]
name = "spam"
version = "1.2.3"
description = "Lovely Spam! Wonderful Spam!"
readme = "README.rst"
requires-python = ">=3.8"
license.file = "LICENSE.txt"
keywords = ["egg", "bacon", "sausage", "tomatoes", "Lobster Thermidor"]
authors = [
    { email = "hi@pradyunsg.me" },
    { name = "Tzu-Ping Chung" }
]
maintainers = [
    { name = "Brett Cannon", email = "brett@python.org" }
]
classifiers = [
    "Development Status :: 4 - Beta",
    "Programming Language :: Python"
]

dependencies = [
    "httpx",
    "gidgethub[httpx]>4.0.0",
    "django>2.1; os_name != 'nt'",
    "django>2.0; os_name == 'nt'"
]

[project.optional-dependencies]
test = [
    "pytest < 5.0.0",
    "pytest-cov[all]"
]

[project.urls]
homepage = "example.com"
documentation = "readthedocs.org"
repository = "github.com"
changelog = "github.com/me/spam/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md"

[project.scripts]
spam-cli = "spam:main_cli"

[project.gui-scripts]
spam-gui = "spam:main_gui"

[project.entry-points."spam.magical"]
tomatoes = "spam:main_tomatoes"
```

### Package locking

Package locking is a mechanism that attempt to reduce package versioning dissimilarities on multi-user projects. It actually
sounds more complex than it is, Lets first try to understand the problem that it tries to solve using an example.
<br> <br>
Say that there are two developers working on your project - <i eg1>Alice</i> and <i eg2>Bob</i>. 

<i eg1>Alice</i> added a dependency to the project: <i str> "x >= 1.0.0" </i>, when installing it she got in her environment 
the package <i str> "x == 1.1.0" </i> (which satisfies the required dependency). Later this week, 
<i eg2>Bob</i> started to work and fetched <i str>"x == 1.1.1"</i> (which also satisfied the required dependency).

<i eg1> Alice </i> filled a bug which unknowingly, happens because of a behavior specific to  <i str> "x == 1.1.0" </i>. 
When <i eg2>Bob</i> tried to fix the bug he could not reproduce it, which of-course lead to both of them fighting and
not talking to each-other for more than a year.  

`pkm`'s Package locking mechanism stores the exact version of the package that was installed inside the file 
<i str> "etc/pkm/packages-lock.toml" </i> alongside other environment specific information. It then tries to use this information 
to reduce dissimilarities across the developers. Unlike many other package locking mechanisms, it takes into consideration 
the fact that different developers may work on totally different environments: they may have different operating systems or may 
use a different version of python, etc. Therefore, it is usable even on these scenarios.

`pkm` automatically updates <i str>"etc/pkm/packages-lock.toml"</i> when you install new dependencies, all you need to do
is to make sure that you commit this file to your version control system.
