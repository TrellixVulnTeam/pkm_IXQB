## System requirements

`pkm` requires `python 3.8+` 

## How to install

There are two main ways to install pkm on your system, if you already have another package manager installed
(most probably <i>pip</i>)

```bash
> pip install pkm-cli
``` 

Alternatively, if you don't have a package manager installed or if you want `pkm` to install itself you can
download [install-pkm.py](/downloads/install-pkm-cli.py) and execute

```bash
> python install-pkm-cli.py
```

> <i>ðŸ’¡ Pro-Tip</i> pkm-cli is distributed as a containerized application package, 
> it built in a way such that there can be no conflicts with other packages installed in
> your system or virtual environment
